      <p>My ideal Unicon toilet would have to be on the 76th floor of the Columbia Tower. I like to releax and look the window and and pretend to drop my magic from the highest point where the view is over the city. Its like I dropping magic on the people of Seattle. They also have the softest TP, sweet smelling soap with real towels to dry off with and other little surpises even though this view is only in the womens bathroom ;).</p>

      Ashkaan Jaberi here. Aka "The Brain" aka "JS slayer" and the originator and founder of the Unicorn Toilet epiphany. Personally, I can not stand the foam soap, I’m all aboard team liquid soap. Also, I can’t recommend it enough to everyone to make the switch to “wet ones” as a toilet paper alternative (when needed).  You’ll wonder how you lived your life up to this point without having used them.  On top of liquid soap and some wet ones, my unicorn would also have a bidets.  When I become King of everything the light touches, my first royal proclomation will be to have them installed in all toilets across the land.

      My name Ricky Foust. You probably already know me from the critically acclaimed broadcast "Rick's Potty Tricks". There are many things that a celebrity of my stature needs from a bathroom in regards to cleanliness and usability. First thing that is a must is touchless machines(sinks, paper towels, toilets, etc) so that I am not touching things the common folk have alreay touched with germs and mediocrity. Next is the zig zag hallway style entrance such as the Costco bathrooms that have no doors. Lastly is a doorman although they typically need an autograph. You can catch the next episode Saturday @ 8, 7 central.

        My ideal Unicon toilet would have to be on the 76th floor of the Columbia Tower. I like to releax and look the window and and pretend to drop my magic from the highest point where the view is over the city. Its like I dropping magic on the people of Seattle. They also have the softest TP, sweet smelling soap with real towels to dry off with and other little surprises even though this view is only in the women's bathroom <i class="em em-wink"></i>
